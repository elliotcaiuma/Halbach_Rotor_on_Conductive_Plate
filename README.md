📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive 3-D analytical and numerical analysis of a travelling Halbach rotor operating above a conductive plate. The research presents:

- Analytical Models: Magnetic charge model and Laplace-Poisson approach for 3D field analysis
- Hybrid Numerical Methods: Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm for coefficient determination
- FEM Validation: Finite Element Method simulations for model verification
- Force Analysis: Levitation and drag force calculations under steady-state conditions

Matlab code for the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm and Fourier Transform included.
